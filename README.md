# **Vehicle Detection Project** 

## Writeup

The goals / steps of this project are the following:
* Perform a Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) feature extraction on a labeled training set of
images and train a classifier Linear SVM classifier, Apply a color transform and append binned color
features, as well as histograms of color, to your HOG feature vector.
* Implement a sliding-window technique and use your trained classifier to search for vehicles.
* Run pipeline on a video stream (start with the test_video.mp4 and later implement on full
project_video.mp4) and create a heat map of recurring detections frame by frame to reject outliers and
follow detected vehicles.
* Estimate a bounding box for vehicles detected.
